# Mobile-Application---QuickVet

INTRODUCTION To THE PROJECT

Due to the prevailing situation throughout the country, it has become really difficult to travel around in emergency situations let alone to a clinic, during emergency situations where it’s hard for people to travel to a clinic to get services for their pets our app will come in handy.
This app comes to the rescue not only during sudden situations that need immediate consultation for animals but also will cut off the burden that pet owners will face regarding transportation issues and to give the maximum comfort to the pet since our app is fully focused on having a doctor who's willing to give their service through home 

From the name of the app itself "QuickVet” it implies the efficiency and speed in contacting a good vet and get the maximum service from them at the comfort of your own home. Our app is simple to use and user friendly, the doctors, as well as the customers, should have the app downloaded in order to get our service, 

First, the customer will have to log in to our app and type in the location they want a doctor from so they can find a nearby doctor close to the area they live, after searching a doctor from the required location then the customer can scroll through a number of available doctors and upon their availability, they can select book now and reserve the doctor and make an appointment. After that, the customer can chat with the doctor and confirm the doctor’s visit, place, time, and the full amount that's needed to be paid. Then the doctor can accept the reservation proposed by the customer and confirm the visit. The doctor can log in to their profiles and easily get access to all their details, upon their need they can also edit or update their account and clinic details.

Also, the pet owners can propose lab reports of their pets and save them, after that, if necessary, they can edit or delete those reports, the reports can be viewed by the doctors and can be monitored for recommendations, and the pet owners can see which doctors viewed their reports.
